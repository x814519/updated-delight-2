# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Local Development
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Production Build
1. Create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Vercel Deployment Requirements

### Sound Files
Make sure to place your notification sound file in the correct location:
1. Create a `sounds` directory in the `public` folder
2. Add your `notification.mp3` file to `public/sounds/`

### Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set in your Vercel project settings.

### Build Command
The build command should be:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Output Directory
The output directory should be set to:
```
build
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter build issues:
1. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
2. Check that all required files are in the correct locations
3. Verify that environment variables are properly set in Vercel
4. Make sure the notification sound file exists in the public/sounds directory
